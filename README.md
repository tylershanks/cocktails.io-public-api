# Cocktails.io

This project is used to quickly look up recipes for many different cocktails and other mixed drinks.

### Why did I create this project?

This project was created to improve my overall understanding of React as a whole. One of my weaker spots was pulling from and effectively using API's. Cocktails.io pulls from `TheCocktailDB.com` for all relevant information.

There are many benefits to using a public API, but there are also drawbacks as well.

Benefits include the sheer number of drinks available. There are hundreds, if not thousands of drinks on this API.

The problem with this, however, is that it is a publicly populated API and it is not perfect. There are many typos, ingredients listed where counts should be, and various other issues.

Overall, this API was perfect because it allowed me to learn a lot and create a useful application at the same time.

I will have this hosted on github for anyone to use. I will personally be using it during my weekend job as a bartender. If there is ever a drink that I do not know, this application will be the fastest way to view the ingredients and how to properly make the drink.

### What tools were used?

This project uses JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, MaterialUI, Webpack, JSON, APIs
