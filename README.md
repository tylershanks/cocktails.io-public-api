# What tools were used?

This project uses JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, MaterialUI, Webpack, JSON, APIs

# What was your motivation?

This project was created to improve my overall understanding of React as a whole. One of my weaker spots was pulling from and effectively using API's. Cocktails.io pulls from `TheCocktailDB.com` for all relevant information.

# Why did you build this project?

I chose to do this project to learn more about React because it is a project that I actually use frequently. I work as a bartender part time and there are a ton of drink recipes and different names for those recipes everywhere. This application gives me one spot where I can quickly search for and find a recipe to make a customer happy.

# What problem does it solve?

Before cocktails.io, if I had to try to search the internet for a drink that someone asked for, it would usually start on Google. There are a few websites I usually like, but even the best ones have their issues. More often than not, it takes a lot of scrolling before I get to the ingredients and then even more scrolling to get to the ingredient counts. The process takes a long time, and that's assuming that all of the unnecessary pictures and other content loads quickly in the first place.  

# What did you learn?

I learned much more about API's and how to properly call them and display the contents on a web page. I also learned about the potential shortcomings of public API's that are not very well maintained. While this one is definitely good enough to use, there are a number of grammar mistakes and general inconsistencies in some of the formatting.

# What makes your project stand out?

This project stands out among the rest of my current projects because of the real world applications. It is something that I keep on my phone and open up on a consistent basis. It is also compatible on desktop and mobile and is incredibly responsive on both. This is much needed because I pretty much use this application exclusively on my phone.
